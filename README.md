This is my personal starship.toml file for the Starship prompt.
To use, move starship.toml to ~/.config/starship.toml (I'm not sure
where to move it to for PowerShell). Edit the config file so that 
under [custom.trim_directory_4] and [custom.trim_directory_5] the
command variable references the absolute path of the trim_dir.sh script.
